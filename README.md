# Link2Payment

Get your Stripe payment link to get paid everywhere, in emails, on a non-SSL website, donation, from an ebook, on a book (by just displaying the payment link, ...).

Psst! It now works also with PayPal! Get easier your PayPal Payment Link than generating a paypal button through the old and painful Paypal website.

The website is based on a homemade lightweight PHP framework (ideal for very small web apps). Feel free to use it if you like it :smiley:
